        <p>When you work long enough with banks and financial institutions, you start hearing the same sentence; whispered, almost embarrassed:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We love blockchain… but we can’t use it. It’s too public.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For years, we’ve helped these institutions experiment with blockchain rails. They see the potential: instant settlement, programmable assets, global reach.</p>
        <p>But every time we built something together, there came this inevitable pause. They’d look at me and say, “So… everyone can see the amounts? The counterparties? Even our clients’ wallets?”</p>
        <p>And suddenly, the room would go quiet.</p>
        <p>They weren’t rejecting blockchain,  they were <em>begging</em> for privacy. Because they understood something that’s easy to forget in Web3: <strong>finance cannot function without confidentiality.</strong></p>
        <p>Private blockchains weren’t the answer either. They’re just centralized servers with a new name,  silos pretending to be networks. Institutions knew that too.</p>
        <p>So they were stuck in between: public blockchains that are too transparent, and private ones that aren’t really blockchains at all.</p>
        <p>That’s when the idea for <strong>Moonlight</strong> began.</p>
        <p>But it’s not just about banks.</p>
        <p>It’s about people too.</p>
        <p>I remember a friend telling me:</p>
        <p>“I’d love to use my crypto for groceries, but I can’t. The store’s wallet is public: anyone who buys there can see who paid what. They could trace my transactions, my habits, my balance. Suddenly, I’m not anonymous anymore.”</p>
        <p>That hit me hard.</p>
        <p>Because what we call “pseudonymity” in blockchain often gives a <em>false sense of privacy</em>. One connection,  a wallet seen in the wild, a transaction to a known address,  and suddenly your entire financial life is open for analysis.</p>
        <p>That’s not freedom. That’s exposure.</p>
        <p>And no one,  not a global bank, not a small business, not a human being buying bread, should have to choose between innovation and privacy.</p>
        <p>So we built Moonlight,  a <strong>privacy layer for Stellar</strong> that restores confidentiality where it belongs.</p>
        <p>With Moonlight, transactions stay private but remain auditable. You can prove compliance <em>without revealing everything</em>. Institutions can finally use blockchain safely. Everyday people can pay without fear.</p>
        <p>Because <strong>privacy is not secrecy: it’s dignity.</strong></p>
        <p>It’s the right to choose what you share, when, and with whom.</p>
        <p>That’s why we built Moonlight.</p>
        <p>Not to hide, but to protect what matters most.</p>
