            <h2>As A Bank</h2>
            <p>Are you beta-testing Moonlight as a financial institution?</p>
            <p>We've already set up a private channel smart contract on Testnet. Now you can connect your financial institution to it!</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Now that you have your URL, it's time to try Moonlight as an end-user.</p>

        <section class="column">
            <h2>As A User</h2>
            <p>Ready to send some private, on-chain transactions?</p>
            <p>When Moonlight reaches production, you'll use it from the UI of your financial institution. It will feel like using any other crypto wallet or bank's send/receive functionality. Until then, it requires some manual setup!</p>
            <p>Start by installing our <a href="#todo">Chrome Browser Extension</a>.</p>
            <p>After it's installed, you'll need to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create an account</li>
              <li>Add a privacy channel (a contract ID)</li>
              <li>Add a privacy provider (a URL)</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
